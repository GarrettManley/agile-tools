# Agile Tools

## About

The goal of this project is to create open source agile tools that can easily be deployed to a firebase instance.

## Tools

This project is made up of different "Tools". Each tool is its own stand alone angular application that can be deployed individually.

There are plans to have a script that builds all theses tools into a single deployment if possible...
